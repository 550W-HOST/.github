# 550W.HOST SHAREHOLDERS  
*A proudly unprofitable domain held by a circle of idiot online individuals*

**What even is "550W"?**  

Straight from the depths of *The Wandering Earth* lore:  

> 550W is a general purpose Quantum Computer created in the 2050s-2070's (exact date not known) as a upgrade to 550C. It proposed MOSS as a name onboard the Navigation Platform (Built by the United Earth Government). See also this [fandom page](https://the-wandering-earth.fandom.com/wiki/550W_(MOSS))

A sci-fi AI that wanted to delete humanity inspired a bunch of nerds to buy this domain name. And honestly? Good for them, at least the domain name is cheap (We got it for only $27/10 years)

**So what’s under [550W.HOST](https://550w.host/)?**  
A collection of weird personal websites stitched together by duct tape, friendship, and shared braincells.

- [**www.550w.host**](https://www.550w.host/):  
  The shareholder registry—a hall of fame for people who saw a cursed domain name and said “yes.”

- [**neetbox.550w.host**](https://neetbox.550w.host/):  
  A wild science experiment featuring [NEETBOX](https://github.com/visualDust/neetbox): a machine learning visualizer for people who want to see their models fail in *HD*.

- [**papercube.550w.host**](https://papercube.550w.host/):  
  A wholesome shrine to the day [PaperCube](https://github.com/PaperCube) touched down in the UK and started their study abroad arc. Ugly page assembled by [VisualDust](https://github.com/VisualDust), in what we assume was a sleep-deprived haze.

- [**visualdust.550w.host**](https://visualdust.550w.host/):  
  The exact same thing, but flipped: [VisualDust](https://github.com/VisualDust)'s arrival in the US is commemorated by [PaperCube](https://github.com/PaperCube). Plastic digital friendship, but with HTML.
